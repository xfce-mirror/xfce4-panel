  by Francois, very pretty. (Jasper)

- Add support for new KIOSK mode. Much better than env variables. (Benedikt)

- Icon theme support : no more panel-specific themes, the panel will now
  follow the icon theme set in the user interface dialog. (Jasper)

- Set partial struts (Jasper)

- Add multihead support. The user needs to set DISPLAY properly to start a 
  new panel on another screen. (Jasper)

- Update list of module list when opening dialog: remove uninstalled modules
  (when not in use) and add newly installed ones. Based on idea of Scott 
  Barron. (Jasper)

- Use a dialog to add items to the panel, instead of a submenu. (Jasper)

- Reduce handle width to show only one line of dots. (Jasper)

- Split out the code for choosing a command and choosing an icon from

  The mailcheck plugin makes use of it and of course the launcher dialog. 
  (Jasper)

- Implement module unloading. Add uniqueness setting to plugins. (Jasper)

- Add pop3 email checking: Use 'pop3://username:password@host' as mailbox.

- Add xinerama aware smart positioning. (Jasper)
