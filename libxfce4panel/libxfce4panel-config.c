 * #LIBXFCE4PANEL_MICRO_VERSION as the three arguments to this
 * function; that produces a check that the library in use is
 * compatible with the version of libxfce4panel the extension was
 * compiled against.
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Checking the runtime version of the Libxfce4panel library</title>
 * <programlisting>
 * const gchar *mismatch;
 * mismatch = libxfce4panel_check_version (LIBXFCE4PANEL_MAJOR_VERSION,

 * if (G_UNLIKELY (mismatch != NULL))
 *   g_error ("Version mismatch: %<!---->s", mismatch);

 *
 * Returns: %NULL if the library is compatible with the given version,
 *          or a string describing the version mismatch. The returned
 *          string is owned by the library and must not be freed or
 *          modified by the caller.
